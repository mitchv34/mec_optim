    "Today we shall study one-dimensional models of matching. The application we shall envision is to the literature on CEO compensation: talented CEOs arguably generate more output if they run large firms than if they run a small business. Hence in these models, the CEO's talent is leveraged by the firm size.\n",
    "\n",
    "The output of a match is CEO's talent multiplied by a term capturing the firm's size. This surplus function belongs to a class which leads to positive assortative matching: the optimal matching will consists of assigning the most talented CEO with the biggest firm, etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "The model we shall follows a literature in family economics, see Becker (1973), and labor economics: Sattinger (1993), Tervio (2008), Gabaix and Landier (2008). Our application will be based on Gabaix and Landier's CEO compensation data. The difference with the empirical literature on marriage is that one observes typically less relevant characteristics on CEOs, but we observe the transfers, which are typically not observed whithin the couple."
